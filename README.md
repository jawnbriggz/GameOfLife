# GameOfLife
Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life

  this a project my friend told me he did in his programming II course at our university. I was excited to do this one but when I took the course with the same teacher we did not do it. sad react. I finally got around to doin it myself. v interested in chaos theory tbh
  
Eventually I would like to

  - setup states to create Gossamer guns and other patterns.
  - add graphical interface (JavaFx)
  - create executable
